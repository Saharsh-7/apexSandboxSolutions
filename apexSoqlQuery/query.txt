### **ðŸ“Œ Tips for Practicing SOQL:**
âœ… Use **Developer Console** or **Workbench** to test queries.  
âœ… Try **querying different standard and custom objects**.  
âœ… Experiment with **joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions**.  
âœ… Learn **query optimization** (e.g., **SELECTIVE** queries).
